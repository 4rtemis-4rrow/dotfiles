## Why?

I made this config as my first proper rice after switching from KDE, as a power user, I wanted it to be perfect for that, but I also wanted to make it simple to use for beginners, while at the same time being as beautiful as possible, tokyo night was the perfect theme for that, offering high contrast in colors to make it easy to code with, at the same time having a great set of colors

## Installation

there is an install.sh script in the dotfiles directory, which will move all the dotfiles to their correct places, on arch based distos, dependancies will be installed by the setup script, if you aren't on an arch based distro, install the following then run the setup script

1. swayfx
2. swaync
3. waybar
4. kitty
5. zsh
6. oh my zsh
7. neovim
8. zathura
9. wofi
10. grim
11. slurp
12. swappy

that is the swayNC client, do note that if your volume level is more than 100%, opening this will reset it to 100%

![](../main/Screenshots/Terminal.png)

that is the terminal and prompt, do note that the red block is there to cover my IP

and finally, the neovim config (that's the source code of my other project, [github.com/4rtemis-4rrow/Ash](Ash))

## GTK and QT themes + icons
since this is all based around tokyo night, you'd want something similar too for GTK or QT, or both

QT:

    sweet

    utterly sweet

GTK:
