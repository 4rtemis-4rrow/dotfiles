## Why?

I made this config as my first proper rice after switching from KDE, as a power user, I wanted it to be perfect for that, but I also wanted to make it simple to use for beginners, while at the same time being as beautiful as possible, tokyonight was the perfect theme for that, offering high contrast in colors to make it easy to code with, at the same time having a great look, very few themes can top tokyonight

## Installation

just run this command

`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4rtemis-4rrow/dotfiles/main/install.sh | sh`

it will install the following, clone these dotfiles, and link them to their proper directory (I chose symlinks because it makes it easier to update from this repo)

note: it's designed to work on arch based distros only, I haven't added support for package managers besides yay and paru, if you use any other distro, you'll have to manually install the dependancies, you can find the list in the install.sh file

there might be missing dependancies that I forgot to add, if you find any, feel free to update the install.sh file, or submit an issue for me to update it

## Screenshots

![](../main/Screenshots/Desktop.png)

this is the base desktop you get

![](../main/Screenshots/Wofi.png)

and that is the application launcher, wofi

![](../main/Screenshots/SwayNC.png)

that is the swayNC client, do note that if your volume level is more than 100%, opening this will reset it to 100%

![](../main/Screenshots/Terminal.png)

that is the terminal and prompt, do note that the red block is there to cover my IP

![](../main/Screenshots/Neovim.png)

and finally, the neovim config (that's the source code of my other project, [github.com/4rtemis-4rrow/Ash](Ash))
